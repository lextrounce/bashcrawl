# Illusions are strong here.
# It is difficult to tell what is a doorway and what is an object.
#
# The magic spell you use to look can be augmented.
#
# From now on, cast your spell like this:
#
# ls -F --color
#
# Directories (the rooms of these catacombs) end with a / symbol.
#
# Encounters (programs) end with a * symbol.
#
# The --color option gives each a different color
#
# You can avoid having to type `ls -F --color` every time by running the
# following:
#
# alias ls='ls -F --color'
#
# This is known as a shell or command alias.  With this alias,
# typing simply ls by itself will run ls -F. Try it out!
#
# To see the current alias use the following command:
# alias ls
#
